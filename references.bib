  abstract = {Developments in digitisation, software and processing power and the accompanying data explosion create significant alterations, dilemmas and possibilities for enterprises and their finance function. The article discusses a model for understanding data, information and knowledge relationships. We apply the model to examine developments in strategy, organisational and cost structures, digitisation, business analytics, outsourcing, offshoring and cloud computing. We argue that organisations need to be sensitised to different types of knowledge, the challenges in creating and applying that knowledge, and be more circumspect about what can be achieved through advances in information-based technologies and software. We point to both the potential of and the complexities presented by Big Data in relation to the finance function generally and to management accounting information provision specifically. We suggest that ‘Big Data’ and data analysis techniques enable executives to act on structured and unstructured information but such action must recognise that the traditionally presumed sequential and linear links among corporate strategy, firm structure and information systems design are no longer in play. Additionally, cost structure changes are affected by developments in how data, information and knowledge can be utilised. We discuss the outsourcing and offshoring of work and their data, information and knowledge ramifications as well as those related to cloud computing. We conclude that the possibilities for the digitally enabled business create a range of ‘information literacy’ challenges as well as new possibilities for accounting information providers.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) showcase impressive capabilities but encounter challenges like hallucination, outdated knowledge, and non-transparent, untraceable reasoning processes. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the generation, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domain-specific information. RAG synergistically merges LLMs' intrinsic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing the Naive RAG, the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG. It meticulously scrutinizes the tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval, the generation and the augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the state-of-the-art technologies embedded in each of these critical components, providing a profound understanding of the advancements in RAG systems. Furthermore, this paper introduces up-to-date evaluation framework and benchmark. At the end, this article delineates the challenges currently faced and points out prospective avenues for research and development.},

Despite the growing concerns, there has been a lack of empirical investigation. In this paper, we provide an empirical examination of LLMs' hallucination behaviors in financial tasks. First, we empirically investigate LLM model's ability of explaining financial concepts and terminologies. Second, we assess LLM models' capacity of querying historical stock prices. Third, to alleviate the hallucination issue, we evaluate the efficacy of four practical methods, including few-shot learning, Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), the Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) method and the prompt-based tool learning method for a function to generate a query command. Finally, our major finding is that off-the-shelf LLMs experience serious hallucination behaviors in financial tasks. Therefore, there is an urgent need to call for research efforts in mitigating LLMs' hallucination.},

We assess the extent of convergence between VAS and IAS/IFRS from the perspective of a single standard, clusters of standards and the standards as a whole. The levels of standards convergence are clustered into four categories: full convergence, substantial convergence, substantial difference and complete difference. Our results indicate that the level of convergence between the two sets of standards only achieves mid‐level convergence. The findings of this study should help policy makers improve VAS to meet international standards.},

However, their implementation raises challenges related to bias, reliability, and professional adaptation. This article evaluates the comparative performance of three approaches to the vertical analysis of income statements: the traditional manual process, a specialized GPT model, and an AI agent integrating GPT with no-code automation tools. Using the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology, 150 experimental analyses were conducted to measure the execution time, variability, and process scalability. The results indicate that GPT substantially reduced execution time compared to the manual baseline, but still required significant human intervention. The AI agent achieved the greatest gains, reducing the average execution time by nearly 75\%, while also demonstrating more stable performance and minimizing the repetitive workload. These findings provide empirical evidence that agent-based automation enhances both efficiency and reliability in accounting workflows, reinforcing its potential to reshape professional practice by reallocating human effort to validation and analytical tasks.},

We discuss the architectures, capabilities, strengths, weaknesses, and use cases of one representative vector database in each category: FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone, and Weaviate. Practical guidelines on the implementation are presented, focused on optimization techniques, strategies for data management, and considerations on security. Comparative insights enable practitioners to align the selection of the vector store with the workflow of RAG solutions. Future trends are explored, such as hybrid search and explainability.},

  abstract = {Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) augments large language models (LLM) by retrieving relevant knowledge, showing promising potential in mitigating LLM hallucinations and enhancing response quality, thereby facilitating the great adoption of LLMs in practice. However, we find that existing RAG systems are inadequate in answering multi-hop queries, which require retrieving and reasoning over multiple pieces of supporting evidence. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no existing RAG benchmarking dataset focuses on multi-hop queries. In this paper, we develop a novel dataset, MultiHop-RAG, which consists of a knowledge base, a large collection of multi-hop queries, their ground-truth answers, and the associated supporting evidence. We detail the procedure of building the dataset, utilizing an English news article dataset as the underlying RAG knowledge base. We demonstrate the benchmarking utility of MultiHop-RAG in two experiments. The first experiment compares different embedding models for retrieving evidence for multi-hop queries. In the second experiment, we examine the capabilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, PaLM, and Llama2-70B, in reasoning and answering multi-hop queries given the evidence. Both experiments reveal that existing RAG methods perform unsatisfactorily in retrieving and answering multi-hop queries. We hope MultiHop-RAG will be a valuable resource for the community in developing effective RAG systems, thereby facilitating greater adoption of LLMs in practice. The MultiHop-RAG and implemented RAG system is publicly available at https://github.com/yixuantt/MultiHop-RAG/.},

  abstract = {The digital transformation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam has progressed significantly in recent years, though it remains constrained by several barriers. Earlier studies revealed that most SMEs were unprepared for Industry 4.0, but surveys after the COVID-19 pandemic show a growing readiness, driven by the clear benefits of digital adoption such as higher productivity, reduced costs, better customer engagement, and expanded market reach. Despite this progress, SMEs continue to face major challenges including limited financial capacity, weak IT infrastructure, shortage of digital skills, and difficulties in changing long-established business habits. The Vietnamese government has introduced multiple supportive policies and national programs to accelerate SME digitalization, ranging from strategic frameworks to practical initiatives like providing local digital platforms and readiness assessments. Recent quantitative research on SMEs highlights that technological infrastructure, leadership, and well-defined digital strategies play the most influential roles in shaping digital transformation, with the intention to adopt digital solutions acting as a critical mediating factor. Complementary qualitative studies also emphasize the cultural and managerial hurdles SMEs encounter, such as resource constraints and resistance to data-driven decision-making, though leaders increasingly recognize the long-term value of digital tools for planning and competitiveness. Overall, while challenges remain, Vietnam’s SMEs are gradually building the momentum needed to succeed in the digital era.}

  abstract = {Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their importance in the evolution of artificial intelligence. However, despite extensive pretraining on multilingual datasets, available open-sourced LLMs exhibit limited effectiveness in processing Vietnamese. The challenge is exacerbated by the absence of systematic benchmark datasets and metrics tailored for Vietnamese LLM evaluation. To mitigate these issues, we have finetuned LLMs specifically for Vietnamese and developed a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing 10 common tasks and 31 metrics. Our evaluation results reveal that the fine-tuned LLMs exhibit enhanced comprehension and generative capabilities in Vietnamese. Moreover, our analysis indicates that models with more parameters can introduce more biases and uncalibrated outputs and the key factor influencing LLM performance is the quality of the training or fine-tuning datasets. These insights underscore the significance of meticulous fine-tuning with high-quality datasets in enhancing LLM performance.},
